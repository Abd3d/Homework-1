                    <p>FC Barcelona was formed in 1899 by businessman Joan Gamper, who advertised for players in a local
                        Barcelona sports magazine. The club’s first trophy was the Copa Macaya (Catalan championship) in
                        1902, and in 1910 “Barça” won the Copa del Rey (“King’s Cup”)—Spain’s leading national football
                        cup competition—for the first time. In total, Barcelona has won 30 Copas del Rey, more than any
                        other team.</p>

                    <p>Nature, in the broadest sense, is the physical world or universe. "Nature" can refer to the phenomena of the physical world, and also to life in general. The study of nature is a large, if not the only, part of science.</p>
